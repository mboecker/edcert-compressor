[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zombiemuffin/edcert-compressor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zombiemuffin/edcert-compressor)

This is the compressor module for my crate "Edcert".
Edcert is a digital signature crate for signing/verifying content based on cryptography.

This crate uses JSON and LZMA to compress the Edcert certificates so they can be saved and/or sent over the network.
